# Infinite Descent into Space
2022 Tartan Hacks Entry

Welcome to Infinite Descent into Space! Each player starts with 10 lives, and is trying to reduce the other player to 0 lives. Each time you get hit by a laser, you lose 1 life.
This game is meant to be played on a single keyboard.

## Controls
Player 1 Controls: A, S, D, and W control movement, and spacebar shoots. You will be playing the green ship.
Player 2 Controls: I, J, K, and L control movement, and backspace shoots. You will be playing the red ship.

## Powerups
Yellow orbs on screen can be shot in order to turn them closer to your color. Once an orb is fully your color, it breaks and you get a 2-use forcefield. 
The color of the forcefield indicates whether it is at 2 uses or 1 use left. 
Blue = 2 uses, Orange = 1 use.

## Enemies
Purple enemies will appear on screen and shoot lasers randomly. They will also temporarily slow down time. The more you hit an enemy, the more frequently it will be able
to shoot bullets. This can be seen by a change in their "rotation" speed (how fast the shape in the middle oscillates). Hitting an enemy enough kills it, default hp is 5 (5 hits to kill it).
